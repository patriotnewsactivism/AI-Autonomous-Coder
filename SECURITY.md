## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Email us directly

Send an email to: **security@ai-agent-system.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### 3. What to expect

- **Response time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours
- **Acknowledgment**: You'll receive confirmation that we've received your report
- **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We'll work to fix the issue as quickly as possible

### 4. Responsible disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We'll work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We'll provide credit for your discovery (if you wish)
- We'll coordinate the public disclosure timing
- We'll ensure the fix is deployed before public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep API keys secure**
   - Never share your API keys publicly
   - Use environment variables for API keys
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Monitor usage for anomalies

2. **Use HTTPS**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Use secure connections for all API calls

3. **Regular updates**
   - Keep your browser updated
   - Use the latest version of the application
   - Update dependencies regularly

4. **Strong authentication**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication where available
   - Use secure password managers

### For Developers

1. **Secure coding practices**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **API security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use proper authentication
   - Validate API keys
   - Monitor for abuse

3. **Data protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Use secure storage
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Follow privacy regulations

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Client-side encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted before transmission
- **API key protection**: Keys stored securely in browser localStorage
- **HTTPS enforcement**: All communications encrypted
- **Input validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
